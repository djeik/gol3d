The wrapper ruleset takes considers only those blocks that "wrap" around the current one as neighbours.
A consequence of this is that a neighbour is at most 2 blocks away. It also means that the corners of the extended, 3x3 cube,
are neglected. We believe this limits diagonal possibilities.

Under this ruleset, the survival conditions are as follows.
Less than 4 neighbours: isolation
Less than 6 neighbours: survival
Less than 8 neighbours: birth
otherwise: overcrowding.
