Considers the entire 3x3 cube that surrounds the current block.

Under this ruleset, the survival conditions are as follows:
Less than 4 blocks: isolation.
Less than 8 blocks: survival.
Less than 12 blocks: birth.
Otherwise: overcrowding.

This ruleset appears to have a big problem: random soups as well as cubes over 9 blocks to a side
appear to go on forever. Likewise, random soups tend to smooth out into spheres and go on forever
rather than disintegrate, which is the expected behaviour.
