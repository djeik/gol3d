GAME OF LIFE 3D
===============

By: Jacob Errington and Alexandre Laporte

Mechanics
=========

A ruleset is given by a four-dimensional vector R, blah.

Basic Controls
==============

Moving the viewpoint: 
* Press and hold W, A, S, D to move in the x-z plane, and Q, E to descend, ascend on the Y axis.
* Move the mouse to change the orientation of the camera.

Globally modifying the configuration:
* Press F to select a pattern file and switch to Normal Mode.
* Press R to select a recording file and switch to Playing Mode.
* Press Return to save the current configuration to a file.
* Press Backspace to erase the current configuration and switch to Normal Mode.

The simulator is modular, i.e. there are several modes that the user can be in. Some modes can be 
used simultaneously, whereas other combinations of modes are exclusive.
If the simulator is run with no arguments on the command line, then it is by default in Normal Mode.
The other modes are Recording Mode, Playing Mode, and Edit Mode.

Normal Mode Features:
* Edit Mode is accessible only from Normal Mode.
* Press B while in Normal Mode to switch to Edit Mode.

Playing Mode Features:
* Edit Mode is inaccessible from Playing Mode.
* Press N while in playing mode to "bail out" into Normal Mode, but preserving the current configuration of cells.
